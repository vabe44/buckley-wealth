                <p>
                    The tree itself – long-lived, resilient, adaptable – beautiful in form and character. Great Basin bristlecone pines (Pinus longaeva) are the oldest non-clonal trees on earth. In Nevada, the oldest trees are found in the mountain ranges of Eastern Nevada. At lower elevations, the bristlecones grow more upright and are covered with green foliage. Above the timberline, high winds, drought, extreme cold, and short growing seasons slow the growth of the trees and contort them into twisted, gnarly forms covered with small amounts of long-lived foliage. The wood becomes dense and resistant to pests, rot, and erosion. Low foliage reduces the risk of fire. The oldest trees are found where the conditions are the most demanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nevada’s oldest bristlecone was believed to be Prometheus. It grew near Wheeler Peak in Nevada and was estimated to be 4,900 years old when a glaciologist cut it down to determine its age! A tree has since been found in the Great Basin that is older than poor Prometheus; its location not been disclosed to the public. The oldest of these ancient trees grows in California and is believed to be over 5,000 years old.

                <p>
                    In 1998, after decades of failed attempts to establish a national park in the Great Basin, a group of dedicated Nevadans joined together to create an advocacy and fundraising group to support the creation of the park. The remarkable chairwoman of the new Great Basin National Park Foundation asked Brian to help. Under her steady leadership, the park’s visitors’ center was built, a new bridge crossed Baker Creek, and an oral history program was started to capture the memories of Great Basin residents. In 1986 President Reagan signed the Great Basin National Park Act of 1986 and launched Nevada’s first national park. We honor those who worked to establish this park and those who maintain it today.
